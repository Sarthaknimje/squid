# Squid Game Tournament - Fixed Issues Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Socket.io Port Conflict Issue

**Problem**: Socket.io server was failing to start because port 3001 was already in use.
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
```

**Solution**:
- Identified the process using port 3001 with `lsof -i :3001`
- Killed the conflicting process with `kill -9 <PID>`
- Confirmed port 3001 was available
- Started Socket.io server successfully

### 2. React Hooks Error

**Problem**: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error in the game page.

**Solution**:
- Fixed conditional hooks issue in `src/app/game/page.tsx`
- Moved useState declarations from within conditional blocks to the top level of the component
- This ensures hooks are called in the same order on every render
- Hooks affected:
  - `agentSurvived` state
  - `progress` state
  - `fieldLength` state
  - `timeTaken` state
  - `resetGame` function

### 3. Added Socket.io Server Test

- Created a test script (`socket-test.js`) to verify Socket.io server connectivity
- Confirmed successful connection, room creation, and event handling
- This helps verify that multiplayer functionality will work as expected

## Current Status

- ✅ Socket.io server running on port 3001
- ✅ Next.js development server running on port 3000
- ✅ React hooks error fixed
- ✅ Game page loading correctly
- ✅ Socket.io connectivity verified

## How to Run the Application

1. Ensure no process is using port 3001:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :3001
   kill -9 <PID>  # If needed
   ```

2. Start the Socket.io server:
   ```bash
   npm run socket-server
   ```

3. In a new terminal, start the Next.js server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Access the application:
   http://localhost:3000/game

## Testing Socket.io Connectivity

Run the test script to verify Socket.io server is working correctly:
```bash
node socket-test.js
```

A successful test will show connection, room creation, and clean disconnection.
