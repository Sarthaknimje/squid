## Running the Game

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

2. Start the Socket.io server (for online multiplayer):
```
npm run socket-server
```

3. In another terminal, start the Next.js development server:

npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:

## Game Rules
Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3Ã—3 grid. Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty cell. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

### Gameplay
1. Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns placing their marks
2. First player to align three of their marks wins
3. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie
